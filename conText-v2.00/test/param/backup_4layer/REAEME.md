for some file like `new_XXX`, it's because I added my own parameters or modified them directly on the original files, so it's not obvious which
part I changed, I can recoginize the part but it's hard for some beginners as there're many parameters.

I renamed the modified version as `new_XXX` to backup and restore the experiment, then get back the original files. We can reproduce the result
anyway, or I can change them according to some real setting of the dataset or experiment.
