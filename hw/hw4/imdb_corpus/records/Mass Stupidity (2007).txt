Mass Stupidity (2007)

The Great Scorpion, the sinister leader of Scorpion Force is revealed and 
is determined to accomplish two things: World domination and getting laid. 
Max Damage the idiotic but good-hearted secret agent, now teamed with a new 
partner Ken Smooth must save the world from Scorpion Force's newest and 
most diabolical scheme to date: a stupidity ray, that once fired from a 
satellite in space, renders whatever it hits completely stupid. To make 
matters even worse, Max's girlfriend Trixie has been kidnapped by the sex 
crazed Great Scorpion and is being forced to marry him in a rather bizarre 
wedding where the best man is a blue-haired wheelchair bound dominatrix 
assassin. Saving the world is not going to be easy, they must get by crazy 
armed guards, Recyclabot, an evil robot that will stand littering from no 
man, and The Temptress, the sultry assassin that is in charge of a squad of 
scantily clad women known as the Lacy Legion. Max will get a little help 
from his boss Mr. Z, his friend Mr. F who always has some secret weapon 
shoved down his pants, and a few armed guards who were able to get past 
Scorpion Force's defenses. Now Max faces his greatest challenge, he must 
choose between saving Trixie from the Great Scorpion or saving the world 
from the destructive Stupidity Ray, and can he live with his decision?
