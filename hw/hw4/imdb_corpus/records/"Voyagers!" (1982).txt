"Voyagers!" (1982)

Phineas Bogg is a member of a group people called Voyagers. They help 
history along. Give it a push where it's needed. He is a regular human that 
was living as a pirate a few hundred years ago, when he was chosen to be a 
voyager. He travels by way of a gold pocket watch like device called an 
omni. When the light is flashing red, it means history is wrong. His job is 
to fix it. In the pilot episode, Bogg ends up in 1982 when his omni 
malfunctions. (He is only supposed to be able to go as far as 1970.) He 
ends up in the apartment where 12 year old Jeffrey Jones and his aunt and 
uncle live. (Jones parents were recently killed in an accident.) While 
there, Jeffrey's dog grabs hold of Bogg's guide book (basically a history 
book.) Bogg being a pretty inept history person has no clue what to do 
without his book. One thing leads to another and Jeffrey falls out of the 
building's window. The only way to save him is for Bogg to jump out after 
him and travel through time. Now Bogg is stuck in time with a 12 year old 
kid (Jeffrey), no guide book, and no way of getting Jeffrey back. But he 
does have an ace in the hole. Jeffrey's dad was a history professor and 
Jeffrey picked up much of his knowledge. So now the two of them, travel 
through time, giving history a push along where it is needed.
