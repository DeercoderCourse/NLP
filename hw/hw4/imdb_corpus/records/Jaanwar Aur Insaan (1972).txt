Jaanwar Aur Insaan (1972)

Shekhar lives a wealthy lifestyle with in widowed mother, Gauri, in Jamuna 
Nagar, India and manages an estate. The region is being terrorized by a 
tiger which was wounded by him and has since become even more fearless and 
a man-eater. Shekhar's attempts to entrap and kill it are all in vain. Then 
Shekhar meets with Meena and both fall in love with each. Their marriage 
cannot take place as Meena's father, Gokuldas, had killed Shekhar's dad. 
But when Mohan kills Gokuldas, the past is forgiven and the couple are 
allowed to get married. The marriage ceremony is marred with the appearance 
of the tiger, which runs away after being chased by a rifle-toting Shekhar. 
After about a year Meena gives birth to Raju but the tiger continues to be 
at large. When the tiger breaks into Shekhar's mansion, a frantic Shekhar 
decides to not return home until he kills it. He sets up a bait but the 
tiger refuses to fall for it. While Shekhar is waiting for the tiger to 
take the bait, it attacks and kills estate workers, compelling Shekhar to 
seek a human bait. When no one volunteers, Shekhar takes the matter into 
his own hands and decides to use Raju as a live bait for this man-eater!!
