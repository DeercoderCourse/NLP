Bordertown Trail (1944)

A gang is opposed to statehood for Texas, and smuggling everything they can 
across the border to keep statehood from happening. Sunset Carson and his 
pal, Frog Millhouse, while on border patrol, receive a message from 
Matthews, a secret agent when they have never met, warning them that a load 
of gunpowder is to be smuggled over the border. They intercept Hank and his 
smugglers and rout them in a gunfight. Returning to Border Patrol 
Headquarters, Sunset and Frog learn that the U. S. Army, under the command 
of Sunset's brother Lieutenant Victor Carson, have been given full 
authority over the Border Patrol station. Meanwhile, "New Orleans", head of 
the anti-statehood faction and the smuggling, learns that Matthews is a 
double agent and kills him, appropriating his identification badge. Posing 
as Matthews, "New Orleans" tricks Lieut. Carson into sending his troops 
onto a wild-goose chase to clear the way for a big gold shipment to be 
smuggled over the border. But Sunset has his suspicions and goes elsewhere. 
The election to determine if Texas will become a state is near and men 
opposed are running contraband across the border. Sunset and Frog are 
Border Patrolmen and have an agent that tips them off by carrier pigeon. 
The Army arrives and the commander is Sunset's brother. When the agent is 
found out and murdered, his fake replacement then leads the soldiers 
astray.
