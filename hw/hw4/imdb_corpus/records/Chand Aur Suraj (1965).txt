Chand Aur Suraj (1965)

Chanderprakash A. Malik lives a middle-classed lifestyle in Bombay, along 
with his wife, Kamla; a son, Munna; and a brother, Surajprakash, who is 
studying medicine. He works in the accounting department as well as does 
tutoring, and hopes that Suraj will complete his education, then go 
overseas to upgrade. He also hopes to get him married to widower Dindayal 
Choudhury's only daughter, Kiran. The young couple are introduced and quite 
dramatically fall in love with each other. Everything appears to go 
according to plan until Chander is accused of stealing Rs.10,000/- and is 
fired. He conceals this information and seeks employment elsewhere - albeit 
in vain. He then attempts to take a loan from Dindayal, who has been told 
about the theft, ends up being humiliated and the wedding gets canceled. 
Then he informs everyone that he is going away on a business trip, and a 
few days later the Police notify them of his accidental death. Devastated, 
the family struggle to come to terms with his sudden passing, but get 
financial relief of Rs.1 Lakhs from the insurance company. Suraj takes the 
money, starts accumulating wealth by gambling, investing in stock, becomes 
arrogant, takes to alcohol, and drops all plans of being a doctor, while 
Kamla starts seeing a male named Mohan on the sly.
