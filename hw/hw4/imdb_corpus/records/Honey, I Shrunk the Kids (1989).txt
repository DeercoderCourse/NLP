Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989)

Wayne Szalinski is your average "nutty scientist", working on a top secret 
machine which miniaturizes objects. When it unexpectedly starts working, 
he's so amazed he forgets to tell his family to be careful. And when they 
wander into his lab... 
Wayne Szalinski is a crazy scientist who invents a miniaturizing machine 
that is so powerful it only blows things up. When the kid next door hits a 
baseball through the window and it lands in the path of the machine's 
laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the two kids next door end 
up becoming tiny. Wayne accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with 
the garbage, so the kids then have to travel through the thick grass back 
to the house, while braving giant bugs, sprinklers and a lawn mower. 
A preoccupied inventor just can't seem to get his electro-magnetic 
shrinking machine to work. Then, when he accidentally shrinks his kids down 
to 1/4-inch tall and tosses them out in the trash, the real adventure 
begins! Now the kids face incredible dangers as they try to make their way 
home through the jungle of their own backyard! Hurricane sprinklers! 
Dive-bombing bees! A runaway lawn mower and much, much more!
