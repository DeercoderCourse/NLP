Travelator (2012)

SLAV (18), an eager "first person" shooter gamer from disadvantaged social 
background, is hired as the best among his friends, to be a real-life 
killer for the Serbian mob. A war refugee born in Slovenia, thus in a rare 
position not needing a valuable American visa, he accepts the latest 
assignment trip to Las Vegas to gun down a criminal insider under Serbian 
state witness protection program. Slav enters the neon city's high style 
living, spots and tails the target and his two official bodyguards, eyeing 
their habits and behavior. The closer he is, the deeper he penetrates into 
the corruption and arrogance of the criminal classes of the Serbian 
society. Slav fathoms the deeds the villain did in past as a cruel warlord. 
Looting, raping, slaying. Today he is even protected by his fatherland to 
indict and expose important political opponents, getting freedom and money 
in return. And Slav never had either of them. Anger overwhelms him as he 
realizes that he himself is a product of such war atrocities and social 
circumstances, part of the human debris on the very bottom, even maybe 'the 
son' of the rapists. Now the time has come for the 'father' who must be 
killed! Slav haunts down the Serbs through the kaleidoscope of artificial 
worlds depicted in Las Vegas. As a dedicated first person shooter, just as 
in games but this time for real, he uses his skill to give chase and shoot, 
and execute his mission in the fountains of blood.
