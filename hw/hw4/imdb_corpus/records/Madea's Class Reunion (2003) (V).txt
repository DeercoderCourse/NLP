Madea's Class Reunion (2003) (V)

Tyler Perry's gun-toting, irreverent granny Madea, played by Perry himself, 
has been entertaining theater audiences with plays like Diary of a Mad 
Black Woman and Madea's Family Reunion. This time, Madea is traveling to 
the Pandora Hotel, the venue for her 50-year class reunion. Running afoul 
of the law, Madea still manages to teach valuable lessons amidst the comedy 
and chaos, addressing the importance of forgiveness and the value of 
friendship. Madea and her colorful crazy neighbor and classmate, Mr. Brown 
(whose wife from the previous play, Mattie, died from Alzheimer's and was 
cremated) help married couple Corey and Trina Jeffrey (Terrell Carter, 
Pamela Taylor) come to terms with infidelity. A woman (Cheryl "Pepsii" 
Riley) hurt by years of torment must give up prostituting herself with her 
abusive babydaddy (D'Wayne Gardner), and reconcile with her tired elderly 
mother (Chandra Currelly-Young) who was fired by the evil manager of the 
Pandora (Chantel Christopher), who is having an affair with a man (Anselmo 
Gordon) who is married to Cora's friend Diana (Judy Peterson), who is too 
reliant on her man. Through all of this craziness, the insane 
bellboy/bartender, "Dr." Willie Leroy Jones (new character played by 
Perry), is causing ruckus in the already rowdy hotel. Willie is suffering 
from Dissociative identity disorder (DID), claiming to have 27 people 
living in his head.
