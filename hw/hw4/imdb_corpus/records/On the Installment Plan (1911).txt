On the Installment Plan (1911)

Two chaps from the country arrive in New York in their search for fame and 
fortune. On their success is dependent a large share in money which they 
will receive from a wealthy uncle and aunt if they make good. They fit up a 
small flat on the installment plan and then look for a position. This they 
find it impossible to pay the installment collector. The collector calls in 
his huskies who remove all the furniture from the young fellows' flat 
leaving the boys nothing but their bath robes and pajamas. Co-incident with 
this occurring they receive a telegram from their aunt and uncle that they 
propose to dine with them that same day. The boys are in an awful 
predicament as they have been writing their relations that they were 
getting along fine in the city. They have to keep up an appearance of 
prosperity. They discover that their neighbor in the next flat has left the 
city for the day and decide to appropriate his belongings temporarily. This 
they do and likewise take advantage of his well stocked larder and some 
extra suits of his clothes. The aunt and uncle arrive and the neighbor 
returns to find the empty flat. His consternation can better be imagined 
than described. Investigation leads him to the boys' room. He indignantly 
takes back his possessions, the uncle and aunt leave high dudgeon and the 
boys are left as they started- with an empty flat and a suit of pajamas 
apiece.
