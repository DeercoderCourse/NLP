Swati (1986)

Sharda is in love with a young man who wants to marry her. Before the 
marriage could take place, some of his friends force themselves upon 
Sharda, leaving her pregnant. When her boyfriend does not show up, she 
decides to keep the child, names her Swati, re-locates to a small town in 
Southern India and finds employment as a nurse with Dr. Rajendra. Years 
later Swati has grown up to be an assertive young woman, who is not only 
outspoken but quite capable of physically defending herself, but her 
attitude alienates her and Sharda from the community in general. She 
befriends Ram Mohan, an activist, who is often in trouble with the police. 
With no one to look after her mother after she gets married, Swati asks 
Rajendra, now a widower, to marry Sharda, to which he agrees. The marriage 
takes place, and both move in to live a wealthy lifestyle with Rajendra and 
his daughter, Anandi. Rajendra and Sharda decide to find a suitable groom 
for Swati, but before that could happen Swati and Anandi have a 
confrontation, things escalate to such an extent that Sharda disowns Swati 
and she moves out, while Anandi's marriage is being arranged with Prasad 
Chiranjivi Gupta. But Sharda's troubles with Swati are far from over - as 
Swati will soon return back into her life - with time with her long-last 
boyfriend, and Swati's biological father - turning Sharda's life upside 
down.
