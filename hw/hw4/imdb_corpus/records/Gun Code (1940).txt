Gun Code (1940)

An extortion gang, headed by Banker J. M. Bradley, controls the cowtown of 
Miller's Flats and saloon owner McClure aids Bradley in operating a 
so-called "business protectice organization". Garrett, reform editor of the 
newspaper is murdered, and Marshal Tim Hammond arrives to find his father, 
Parson Hammond, has also been killed. Garrett's young son, Jerry, takes Tim 
to his sister Betty, who is now editing the paper. Slim Doyle, collector 
for the gang, is beaten up by Tim as he tries to collect money from Betty. 
Under the name of Hays, Tim opens up a blacksmith shop. Bradley discovers 
Tim's true identity and orders him eliminated. With the aid of Sheriff 
Kramer, Tim has Slim arrested on a trumped-up charge of murder, and then 
incites the townspeople to stage a "fake" attack on the jail to lynch Slim, 
who breaks down and offers to confess. Betty is informed by telephone that 
the gang has kidnapped Jerry and he will only be released in exchange for 
Slim. The sheriff and Tim fake a fight that allows Slim to excape, but Tim 
has men posted along the road to watch where Slim goes. Tim and a posse 
follow and wipe out all the gang members except the unknown leader. While 
searching the hideout shack, Tim sees some peculiar characters scrawled on 
a wall, and remembers having seen Bradley scratch similar figures on his 
desk. This gives Tim sufficient evidence to go after Bradley.
