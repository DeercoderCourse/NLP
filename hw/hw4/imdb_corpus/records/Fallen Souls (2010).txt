Fallen Souls (2010)

Fallen Souls is a tale of a young man's journey from revenge to 
self-discovery. It creates a new unique genre of the supernatural and draws 
on time-honored elements of a revenge thriller, then travels the difficult 
journey to understanding faith and unconditional love for god, family and 
self. Dominic, a diligent blue collar factory worker, husband to the 
perfect woman and father to a heavenly child, lives a humble little life. 
When he stumbles upon the slain and bloodied bodies of both wife and child 
in their home, Dominic's dream life turns into a nightmare. Grief stricken, 
he takes matters into his own hands and begins a desperate search through 
Chicago's worst slums to the crest of it's upper society, hunting a killer 
known as the "Silent Slasher" who's managed to elude capture by Chicago's 
finest for years, hoping to avenge his family that they may finally rest in 
peace. This vengeful quest reveals to our hero that all things aren't 
always as they seem. Angels don't always have wings, devils don't always 
wear horns and that the spiritual war between good and evil is played out 
in day to day battles between mankind, influenced by the forces both sworn 
to protect us and those who would seek to destroy us.
