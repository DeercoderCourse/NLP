Flaming Lead (1939)

Cowhand Ken Clark is stranded in Chicago, and temporarily takes a job as a 
sharp-shooter entertainer in a night club, with the intention of getting 
enough money together to get back to his beloved Arizona. Frank Gordon, 
while drunk, is about to be rolled by the club bouncer, but Ken interferes 
and earns Clark's gratitude. Gordon gets a telegram from Kay Burke, the 
daughter of his partner in Arizona, notifying him that her father, Jim 
Burke, has been killed by rustlers. The ranch has a U.S. Army contract to 
furnish horses, but she sees little hope of being able to make good because 
the stock is being rustled, and she asks Gordon for his help. The latter is 
persuaded by Ken to answer her call for help, but Gordon insists that Ken 
accompany him, and also take his place as his substitute. Ken agrees. He 
soon discovers that the problems lie with a ranch employee that has been 
aiding the rustlers. 
Creely is rustling Berke's horses so he can't fulfill his Army contract. 
When they kill Berke, his daughter sends for part owner Gordon. When the 
always drunk Gordon arrives he passes off his friend Ken as himself. Now 
posing as Gordon, Ken soon finds himself the new target of Creely's outlaw 
gang.
