The Bench (2006) (V)

Gerald is teaching Lewis, his trainee, the art of begging. He takes Lewis 
to the middle of a busy park in order to stop pedestrians as they walk by 
the bench in which they are sitting. Lewis messes up at every turn and 
Gerald is there to guide him towards more effective methods of begging. 
They use a device called a Sheep Tracker to scan the area for potential 
customers. Gerald places Lewis in different types of situations in order to 
teach him how to increase revenue for the company. Lewis tries his best to 
impress Greald, but fails on every account. Chris, the 3-11 shift, shows up 
and takes over for Lewis. It is then revealed that the beggars are really 
rich men pretending to be homeless just for the sake of the company. Mr. 
Thomas asks his girlfriend, Melissa, to meet him at the bench. He attempts 
to break up with her. She flies into a rage and attempts to kill him. 
During the struggle, they stumble upon the Sheep Tracker. Melissa sees that 
it has her personal information in its database and accuses Mr. Thomas of 
stalking her and other women. She threatens to take the device to the 
police when another beggar, Chris, takes it upon himself to chase her down 
before the begging industry is unveiled.
