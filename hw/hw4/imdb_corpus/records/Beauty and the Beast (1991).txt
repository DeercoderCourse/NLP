Beauty and the Beast (1991)

Belle is a girl who is dissatisfied with life in a small provincial French 
town, constantly trying to fend off the misplaced "affections" of conceited 
Gaston. The Beast is a prince who was placed under a spell because he could 
not love. A wrong turn taken by Maurice, Belle's father, causes the two to 
meet. 
Prince Adam was cursed to a beast form by Enchantress who saw no love in 
his arrogant heart for others. The one way he could break the spell was to 
learn to love another and earn her love in return before the last petal 
from his enchanted rose fell, which would bloom until his twenty-first 
birthday. But who could ever learn to love a beast? Ten years later, 
Maurice, an inventor from a nearby village, becomes lost in the woods and 
seeks shelter in the Beast's castle, the Beast imprisons him for 
trespassing. His daughter Belle, a bookworm who dreams of life outside her 
provincial village, finds him trapped in the castle and offers her place in 
his stead. The Beast accepts with a promise she'll remain in the castle 
forever. In the beginning Belle views him as nothing more than a monster, 
he views her as difficult and stubborn. But the two soon taste the 
bitter-sweetness of finding you can change and learning you were wrong.
