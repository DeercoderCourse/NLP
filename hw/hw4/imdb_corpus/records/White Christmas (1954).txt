White Christmas (1954)

After leaving the Army after W.W.II, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis team up to 
become a top song-and-dance act. Davis plays matchmaker and introduces 
Wallace to a pair of beautiful sisters (Betty and Judy) who also have a 
song-and-dance act. When Betty and Judy travel to a Vermont lodge to 
perform a Christmas show, Wallace and Davis follow, only to find their 
former commander, General Waverly, is the lodge owner. A series of romantic 
mix-ups ensue as the performers try to help the General. 
After World War II, song and dance men Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, form a 
successful partnership eventually becoming top Broadway producers. Bob 
agrees to take in a nightclub act by the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, as 
a favor, so he thinks, for their brother who served with Bob and Phil in 
the war. Phil has always been trying to get Bob interested in a girl, 
usually one in the show but when he realizes that Bob is smitten with 
Betty, he arranges to accompany them to their show at a small Vermont Inn. 
Imagine their surprise when they learn that their old commanding officer, 
Major General Tom Waverley, is the owner. He's sunk his savings and his 
pension into the venture but it has yet to snow and it looks like he's on 
the verge of bankruptcy. They come up with a plan to help the General out 
but a series of misunderstandings leads to a rift between Bob and Betty 
leaving it Phil and Judy to try and get them back together.
