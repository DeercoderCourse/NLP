Northern Lights (2009/I)

Cinematography is one of the most exquisite art forms involved in the 
process of filmmaking- the way it heightens themes, punctuates action, 
lights an actor's face or dances with shadows can make or break a film, yet 
the visual way it tells the story is often overlooked in the minds of 
audience members all around the world. Though they are rarely seen on the 
opposite side of the lens, these unsung heroes of the moving image will be 
brought right into focus in Northern Lights, a documentary that will 
celebrate and give an appreciation of the Canadian Cinematographer's role 
in filmmaking. Northern Lights features interviews with dozens of the 
medium's greatest Cinematographers and acclaimed Canadian Directors who 
provide further insight into the Director & Cinematographer collaboration. 
They relate stories of the films, television series or commercials they've 
worked on, the problems they've solved, the innovations they've made 
standard, one will get a full measure of the love and obsession that goes 
into the creation of motion pictures. Even if some people have only a 
passing interest in film, this will change the way they look at movies and 
the talented filmmakers behind the scenes that make the magic real for us.
