Snakeskin (2001)

Alice (Lynskey) lives in suburban Christchurch, the 'safest place in the 
world', but she longs for an adventure of American proportions (guns, 
murder, sex, drugs etc). Her best friend Craig (O'Gorman) changes his name 
to Johnny because Craig isn't heroic enough for Alice. He is in love with 
her and waiting for her to settle down so that he can be with her. She 
likes hanging out with him because of the hot as car he did up himself, a 
convertible Valiant. Together they roam the roads around SE NZ picking up 
hitchhikers and looking for excitement. One day they pick up Seth, an 
American Texas type, with snakeskin boots and a cowboy hat. He is on the 
run from a gang of skinheads who he stole money from, a Mr. Trippy truck 
with a couple who he stole a whole crap load of drugs off, and a big Moari 
dude on a motorcycle. Alice is immediately enchanted by Seth, Johnny 
jealous. Seth tricks Alice into taking a trip with him. The chase leads 
them away from their home and toward the hazardous roads over the Southern 
Alps. As they head toward the coast Alices trip turns bad and she begins 
hallucinating, or is Seth really superhuman?
