Gumrah (1963)

Meena lives with her retired and widowed dad in picturesque Nainital. She 
has a sister, Kamla, married to a well-known Barrister, Ashok, and two 
children, Pappu and Dolly. When Kamla comes for a visit, she finds out that 
Meena is in love with Rajendra, a painter and singer, who she approves of 
him, and would like to get them married. Before that could happen she has 
an accident and passes away, leaving the care of her children to Meena. 
Subsequently, their father arranges Meena's marriage with Ashok, fearing 
ill-treatment by another woman as the step-mother. Meena marries Ashok and 
goes to live in his palatial house in Bombay. After a year when they return 
to Nainital, a visibly upset Rajendra gets in touch with Meena and they 
rekindle their romance. When Meena gets back to Bombay, Rajendra follows 
her and they continue to meet in secret. Things gets complicated when Meena 
finds out that Rajendra is married to a woman named Leela, who also wants 
to blackmail her in order to keep her mouth shut. Angry at this betrayal at 
the hands of her lover, Meena has two ways out - continue to pay Leela for 
the rest of her life - or kill herself.
