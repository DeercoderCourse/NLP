Blur (2011/I)

RAYMOND WEIR is a shut in computer genius surviving in the post dot-com 
era. Disabled as a result of a home invasion that took the life of his late 
wife, SARAH, Raymond sits in his makeshift apartment above a run down bar, 
over medicated, mourning her loss and contemplating suicide. His only 
contact with the world, besides his close friend PAUL are the three 
computer screens that blink emotionlessly at him twenty four hours a day, 
through sleepless nights. There, he sees the universe, filled with images 
of webcams around the world, from petty crimes and private confessions, to 
public tragedies and natural disasters. It is here, one night, as Raymond 
finishes piecing together an old video recording of his late wife, that he 
sees a mysterious woman, LAYLA. The image of her is unexpected, sexual, as 
she goes through a ritualistic set of gestures that leads to an emotional 
plea to Raymond. Alone, in an undisclosed location, she begins confessing 
in a sing song voice, speaking to him about her dreams, in words that echo 
Sarah's. As Raymond listens, he begins to realize that not only may she 
know the key to the death of Sarah, but that she herself may be in danger, 
and that it is up to him to save her before she too becomes a victim.
