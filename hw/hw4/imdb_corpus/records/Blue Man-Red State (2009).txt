Blue Man/Red State (2009)

This feature length high definition documentary follows one of the Nation's 
most controversial yet progressive leaders, Former Salt Lake City Mayor 
Rocky Anderson. In post-modern verite style, "Blue Man / Red State" 
captures Mayor Anderson during his last year in office and then on to his 
founding of "High Road for Human Rights". In following the social action of 
this Mayor "Blue Man/Red State reveals how our democracy, although fragile, 
is finally becoming more than an experiment against eons of autocracy. In 
fact, it may actually work. Called "America's Mayor" by filmmaker Michael 
Moore, "America's Newest Folk Hero" by The Nation Magazine, and a "kook" by 
Fox Network's Bill O'Reilly, Utahns just call him "Rocky." No matter what 
you call him, Rocky Anderson is worth watching. Rocky's frustration with 
the political logjam created by National Politicians' failure to act on the 
crucial issues of our time has led him to take the lead. Seeking out 
activist National and International leaders he has formed coalitions for 
work on Global Warming, Equal Rights, Reformative Justice, Immigration 
Reform, the Iraq War and most importantly the preservation of the 
Constitution of the United States. "Blue Man/Red State" reveals through 
Rocky Anderson's journey that it is not too late to be "We, the People, of 
the United States of America."
