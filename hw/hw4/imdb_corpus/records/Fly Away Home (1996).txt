Fly Away Home (1996)

Amy is only 13 years old when her mother is killed in an auto wreck in New 
Zealand. She goes to Canada to live with her father, an eccentric inventor 
whom she barely knows. Amy is miserable in her new life...that is until she 
discovers a nest of goose eggs that were abandoned when developers began 
tearing up a local forest. The eggs hatch and Amy becomes "Mama Goose". The 
young birds must fly south for the winter, but who will lead them there? 
With a pair of ultralight airplanes, Amy, her dad and their friends must 
find a way to do it... 
Amy is a young teenager when she loses her mother to a car accident. 
Because of it, she moves in with her father. Amy finds her new life 
absolutely miserable, until she finds abandoned goose eggs from when the 
developers tore up the forest behind her home. They soon hatch and Amy 
becomes their "mother" and takes care of them. Winter quickly arrives, and 
the geese must go south. But who will show them the way? It is up to Amy 
and her father to make sure that the young geese find their way, and with 
the assistance of her father's invention, they do just that. 
Amy is reunited with her father after her mother's death. She withdraws 
from her new life, and life in general, until she finds a reason to 
participate in something: the preservation, parenting, and eventual 
migration-instruction of a flock of orphaned geese.
