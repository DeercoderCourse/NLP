Blade Runner (1982)

In a cyberpunk vision of the future, man has developed the technology to 
create replicants, human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth 
but with fixed lifespans. In Los Angeles, 2019, Deckard is a Blade Runner, 
a cop who specialises in terminating replicants. Originally in retirement, 
he is forced to re-enter the force when six replicants escape from an 
offworld colony to Earth. 
Los Angeles, 2019: Rick Deckard of the LAPD's Blade Runner unit prowls the 
steel & micro-chip jungle of the 21st century for assumed humanoids known 
as 'replicants'. Replicants were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on 
an Off-World Colony, and are to be terminated upon detection. Man's 
obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired. 
Deckard is a Blade Runner, a police man of the future who hunts down and 
terminates replicants, artificially created humans. He wants to get out of 
the force, but is drawn back in when 4 "skin jobs", a slang term for 
replicants, hijack a ship back to Earth. The city that Deckard must search 
for his prey is a huge, sprawling, bleak vision of the future. This film 
questions what it is to be human, and why life is so precious.
