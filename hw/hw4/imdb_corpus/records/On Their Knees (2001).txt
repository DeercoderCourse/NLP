On Their Knees (2001)

Mo and Willie are half-sisters who have grown apart over time. Willie is a 
rebellious, hard-drinking waitress while Mo toils away in an office. When 
their grandmother, who raised them after the death of their mother, passes 
away, the two siblings reunite. Although they have not spoken for some 
time, Mo convinces her sister that their grandmother deserves to be buried 
back on the east coast, in the place where she grew up and which is home to 
a family they've never known. The first of many problems is that they have 
to steal the body; the next is that they have no idea where they're going. 
Nonetheless, the two quickly turn into bumbling, bickering but virtuous 
thieves. After buying a used refrigerated ice cream truck to transport the 
body, the siblings set out across the country. Moving from small town to 
small town, they come into contact with a bevy of eccentric characters, 
soon realize that they have a cash flow problem and are forced to continue 
their criminal ways. Along the route, however, they are able to give others 
in need a helping hand and to remember, eventually, how to have fun again, 
especially during a memorable romp through the woods. When they finally 
arrive, they are met with a reception they never could have imagined.
