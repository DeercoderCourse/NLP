Next Stop, Life (2010)

Keren's role as a single mother may perhaps not be the most unique of its 
kind, but she brings a powerful story on-screen, because she is NOT afraid 
to share her story. During her pregnancy, she had suffered ongoing violence 
from the father, and after he was born, she found herself living in a 
women's shelter. Today at 28, Keren is raising her 2.5 year old son, living 
in an arranged/protected apartment, and maintaining a job while her son is 
in daycare. But unfortunately, as we witness in these 7 short minutes of 
the film, her life is still not at peace.
