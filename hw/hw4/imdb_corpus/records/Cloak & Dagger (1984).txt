11-year-old Davey, whose mother is dead and whose father doesn't spend 
nearly enough time with him. So the boy loses himself in video games--and 
even has an imaginary friend, a super-resourceful secret agent. When he 
accidentally comes into possession of a spy group's secret plans, and winds 
up on the run from them, he must learn to rely on himself and his imaginary 
pal to save his skin. But, in the end, Dad proves to be his real hero. 
11-year-old Davey, whose mother is dead and whose father is preoccupied 
with his own problems, has retreated into a world of video games and an 
imaginary hero-pal, the swashbuckling superspy Jack Flack. When an FBI 
agent about to be murdered slips him a video cartridge containing 
top-secret data, Davey is suddenly plunged into the intrigue and danger of 
real-life espionage. No adult believes his story, so he must run a gauntlet 
of violence and villainy aided only by a younger girl and the encouragement 
of "Jack Flack" at his side. How long can a comic-book role model guide him 
through this encounter with reality? 
A young boy, with a penchant for spy thrillers and video games, finds 
himself in the middle of real espionage when he's relentlessly pursued by 
spies after he comes into possession of a video game cartridge containing 
top-secret government info.
