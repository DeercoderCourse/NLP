A Darker Shade of Gray (2009)

Detective Milton Gray is tormented by his past and has no faith in his 
future. Once a respected officer of the law, he is now a guilt-ridden, 
pill-popping addict; a fallen sentinel. He is a man who wants desperately 
to do the right thing, but has no idea what that is. He can tell right from 
wrong but doesn't know where he lies on the spectrum. He views his job as 
not only to protect the innocent but to punish the guilty, so when he finds 
himself in the wrong he reacts in a self-destructive fashion. He reaches 
the breaking point, after a startling revelation regarding a previous case 
with an executed young man. Gray is suspended by his superior and forced to 
take some time off. Despite attempts of comfort by his partner, Carl 
Kincaid, Gray ostracizes himself. Unknown to Gray, a mysterious figure 
connected to his past is watching him. His lost faith and overwhelming 
guilt drive Milton to systematically destroy himself. Spurned by his 
Captain and looked down on by his partner, Gray, returns home and resigns 
to take his own life. Before he can complete the task, a scream distracts 
him. Taking this as a chance for redemption, Gray goes to investigate. What 
he does not know is that his mysterious stalker and his old case are 
dangerously related, and that the world can't be divided into black and 
white. It's all just a darker shade of Gray.
