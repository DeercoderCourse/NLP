Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck (1953)

An old man living in an oriental city tells the story of his life to a 
group of kids: He too was once a young boy by the name of Little Muck - 
much like them, but with better manners and a heap of problems. Having lost 
his father at early age, little Muck is expelled from home by his greedy 
relatives. He wanders off into the desert hoping to find the merchant who 
sells good fortune. Amidst the dunes of sand he comes across a small house 
owned by a wicked woman and her many cats. She wants to make Little Muck 
her servant, but he manages to escape by stealing a pair of magic shoes 
which enable him to run faster than any man in the country. From there he 
heads right into the next set of challenges... Based on a fairy tale by 
Wilhelm Hauff. 
Little Mook searches for the elusive Merchant of Luck. With the help of a 
pair of magic shoes which enable him to run faster than even the Sultan's 
fastest runner, and a magic wand that leads to the most splendid of 
treasures, Little Mook helps his good friend Prince Hassan to win the hand 
of the lovely Amarza, the Sultan's daughter.
