Rhythm of the Rio Grande (1940)

Tex Regan (Tex Ritter) arrives at the Crane ranch just as Blackie (Earl 
Douglas) and Pete (Chick Hannon) are preparing to burn it. He drives them 
off, but is accused by Ruth Crane (Suzan Dale) of being in league with 
Pablo, the bandit, who is blamed for most of the territory's crime. 
Recognizing Blackie as a henchman of Jim Bannister (Tristram Coffin), Tex 
starts for the Bannister ranch but is captured and imprisoned. Bannister, 
however, sets him free. Although Bannister has never lost any cattle to 
Pablo, an emblem similar to those left after every raid blamed on Pablo, is 
found in Bannister's house. Tex, knowing Pablo to be innocent and actually 
only searching for the killer of his sister, persuades the outlaw to change 
his hide-out and then sets out to capture Bannister, the leader of the 
gang. But Tex is arrested as being a member of Pablo's gang and Pablo, 
seeing Tex with the lawmen, believes himself double-crossed. 
Looking for his missing friend, Tex arrives in an area besieged by the 
bandit Pablo whom the Rangers have been unable to catch. When Tex is 
captured by Pablo he soon realizes Pablo, who is looking for the killer of 
his sister, is innocent of the raids blamed on him. Tex thinks he knows who 
that man is and also suspects that same man is responsible for the 
disappeance of his friend.
