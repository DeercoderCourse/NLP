Poker (1992) (V)

In a remote wilderness cabin, four friends unite once a year to play a 
friendly game of poker and reminisce on old times. But this time, there is 
something else... Frank, shaken, arrives early and tells Joe that Scott's 
car was in the canyon and that some creature had Scott. Joe, not buying 
Frank's story, but thinking that something may have happened to Scott , 
nonetheless decides to go back to the canyon. But Al's arrival and 
hesitation to waste any time, wanting to get the game going, convinces Joe 
that the entire story is delusional. When Scott, unharmed, finally arrives, 
Al and Joe lay Frank's story to rest and they begin their annual game of 
poker. But Frank, having seen the actual creature, is not convinced. 
Refusing to partake in the game he begins to accuse Scott of an 
extra-terrestrial possession. As the cards are then dealt a psychological 
thriller unfolds. Frank consistently raises questions about Scott, then 
shifting suspicion onto Al. But Joe recalls that something strange did 
happened earlier, before anyone had arrived. A strange phone call that 
didn't sound human... In the end the situation goes out of control and the 
friendly game of poker becomes a game of wits, accusations, and eventually 
violence.
