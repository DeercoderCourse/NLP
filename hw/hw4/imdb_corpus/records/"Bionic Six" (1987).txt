The Bionic Six was a cartoon shown on US TV from 1987-88. The show only 
lasted for one season of 65 episodes. It was set in the "near" future, and 
consisted of a politically correct family. The father was a test pilot and 
gourmet cook, the mother a marine biologist, with four children. The 
blonde-haired daughter (Meg) was a Valley Girl, the brown-haired son (Eric) 
was on the high school baseball team, the African-American son (J.D.) was 
top of his class, and the Oriental son (Bunji) was learning karate. They 
and Dr. Sharp had to constantly stop Dr. Scarab, Dr. Sharp's evil brother, 
from taking over the world. Dr. Scarab had five terrorists he created to 
help him in his evil deeds. The Bionic Six were given their powers by Dr. 
Sharp's bionizing machine, and were clearly superior to Dr. Scarab's 
technology. So Dr. Scarab often used tricky plots to try to capture or kill 
the Bionic Six while searching for the technological fountain of youth and 
immortality.
