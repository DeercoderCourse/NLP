A Simple Plan (1998)

Three diverse characters, for the most part intellectually challenged, find 
a deserted plane with a bag full of millions of dollars inside. They devise 
a simple plan to keep the money if no-one claims it. Ofcourse, nothing 
turns out simple... 
Two brothers, one a mild-mannered hardware store manager, the other an 
unemployed slob and a friend stumble onto $4.4 million cash in stolen 
money. The new-found booty leads Hank, the store manager (with help from 
his cunning wife), to great lengths to keep the money a secret from local 
authorities. The three men begin to doubt each other's trust, which leads 
to shocking results of lies and deceit. 
When Hank, Jacob and Lou find $4.4 million inside a crashed plane in a 
nature preserve, they quickly come up with the plan to keep the money safe 
until the plane has been found by others and the dust has settled. But 
Jacob, Hank's brother, and Lou, a friend, do not behave the way they 
decided to. Lou, constantly in financial debt, wants his share soon and 
Jacob wishes to renovate their parents' farm. The trusty atmosphere between 
the unequal partners dissolves slowly, and intrigues are spun. Also, 
accidents start happening and when an FBI agent comes into town, looking 
for a crashed plane, Hank and his partners get into very deep water...
