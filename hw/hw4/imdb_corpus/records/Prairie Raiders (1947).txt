Prairie Raiders (1947)

Steve Bolton, a Department of the Interior agent, has given young "Bronc" 
Masters a lease to 50,000 acres of range land. Several months later "Bronc" 
discovers a strange notice on the land, warning off trespassers. He thinks 
that Steve has leased the same land twice, grabs a gun and heads for town, 
although his level-headed girl friend, Ann Bradford, attempts to stop him. 
Steve pacifies him, and they both ride out to the range and discover a gang 
of men, led by "Spud" Henry, rounding up the wild horses. Henry produces a 
paper, similar to the one Steve gave "Bronc" and signed by the Secretary of 
the Interior, and Steve, knowing the paper is a forgery, slaps an 
injunction on the land, forbidding any horses to be rounded up until the 
matter is cleared. Henry has had a cleaver counterfeiter forge the 
signature and knows he will be found out, so he orders his men to rustle 
the horses and run them to the railroad siding for shipment. But the 
Durango Kid takes a hand. 
Government Agent Steve leases land to Masters so he can bring in horses for 
the Army. Henley has obtained a forged lease for the same land and Steve is 
unable to prove it's a fake. While Steve checks with Washington, Henley 
plans to roundup and ship the horses. Masters also intends to roundup the 
horses and he has the Durango Kid on his side in the battle with Henley.
