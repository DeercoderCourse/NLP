8 Man After (1993) (V)

Whatever happened to 8-Man? Why did he suddenly disappear, never to be seen 
again? This was the question on Sachiko's mind, as she couldn't forget 
about that fateful day when she learned the truth. When she found out 
Rachiro Azuma (whom she called Azuma-san) was the 8-Man, Azuma disappeared, 
never to be seen again...it seemed. She went on with her life, working in 
Public Relations for the Biotechno Corporation. Times have changed. Crime 
has a new face and a new mode. Newer technology has become part of the 
game, but the number one player is still power. Power is what high crime is 
looking for. So what do you do when the criminals turn into near-invincible 
cyborgs? The answer: bring back an old cyborg crime fighter, one capable of 
combatting this new threat. 8-Man returns to the scene, but he (like the 
scene) has changed. His mind is different, as he has a new host with a 
different set of priorities. 8-Man's new host is private detective Hazama 
Itsuru, a hard-nosed, sometimes violent man who likes to do things his way. 
So what does that mean when he's 8-Man? To put it short, he's quick and 
usually brutal. And since he still remembers his original life, he also 
remembers his grudges and his old enemies. With such a volatile mind in 
such a powerful body, what could possibly happen? That's the question that 
has EVERYONE worried.
