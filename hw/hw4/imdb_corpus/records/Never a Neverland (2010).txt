Never a Neverland (2010)

The African nation of Swaziland is the size of New Jersey, but it has the 
highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world. With a country so small and a 
problem so big - in 10 years there will be NO ADULTS unless something 
drastic is done. But don't worry - this is not a sad, African story. With 
the world's last remaining absolute monarch in power, Pashu - the first 
Princess of Swaziland - narrates how Africans, Americans, teens, moms, 
servants and leaders unite to help a king heal his people before Swaziland 
becomes a Never-land. 
NEVER A NEVERLAND documents the story of how Africans, Americans, teens, 
moms, charities, and entrepreneurs unite to help bring hope and healing to 
Swaziland before its high rate of HIV/AIDS threatens to leave the country 
orphaned by the year 2030. When one California mom is inspired by Martin 
Luther King Jr's peace march across Alabama, she unites 20 humanitarians 
with nearly a dozen African and American charitable & commercial partners 
for a first historic S.O.S walk across Swaziland. Along the way, they 
discover the complexity behind Africa's last remaining absolute monarchy, 
the painful reality of children raising children in a country dying of 
AIDS, and the restorative solution rising inside and outside of Swaziland.
