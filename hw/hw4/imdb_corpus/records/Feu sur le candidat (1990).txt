Feu sur le candidat (1990)

Robert Cavaillon is the king of the pet food industry. After he sold the 
factory to his workers, he decided to run for office. His campaign in 
support of animal rights gives him a lead in the opinion polls - which 
worries the main political parties. Since his past is unassailable, his 
political opponents decide to give the job of getting rid of him to a 
bizarre couple - a professional killer called Jean and a high-class call 
girl named Clara. The pair has to ruin him with scandal and then eliminate 
him for good. Jean's first attempt at his task is a failure: instead of a 
killer he ends up looking like Cavaillon's savior and friend. Clara is 
forced to play the role of the killer's tender wife, because their victim 
sees them as a kindly pair not interested in using him for his position 
like everyone else. Between one bungled assassination attempt and the next, 
the three are enmeshed in an intense relationship in which their roles all 
change: Clara discovers the pleasure of power, using the two men as pawns 
in her game: Jean is a failed assassin and becomes the victim of a chain of 
accidents; Cavaillon will taste the fruits of political victory, but a 
fixed one, as usual.
