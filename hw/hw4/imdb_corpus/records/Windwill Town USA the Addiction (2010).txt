Windwill Town USA the Addiction (2010)

Living in Windwill Town, USA is The Lexie Family, a dysfunctional family of 
four that suffer with addiction problems. JACQUES LEXIE, the patriarch, is 
a heavy alcoholic who has lost his job as owner of the Windwill Town Docks 
due to severe drinking. He is being forced to attend regular AA and therapy 
meetings with Dr. Goldman in order to help Jacques get his life on track so 
he can return to work. Taylor Lexie, the eldest son, has a heavy gambling 
problem that causes him to lose his money. Drake Lexie, the middle son, is 
addicted to drugs. He purchases drugs frequently from his brother as well 
as Brad Galli, a local street mobster. When Drake fails to pay Brad Galli 
on time, Brad and his associate Krystal Aurora plans on making a fatal 
example out of Drake. MEGAN LEXIE, Jacques' 16 year old daughter, is 
heavily addicted to sex. She frequently sleeps with men in exchange for 
them spending money on her. Megan thinks she has power over these men, but 
her seduction is compromised when she starts seeing Ricky, an older man who 
simply wants to use Megan for sexual pleasure. Eventually, the addiction 
problems of Jacques, Taylor, Drake and Megan will not only negatively 
impact their lives, but also the lives of the family members around them.
