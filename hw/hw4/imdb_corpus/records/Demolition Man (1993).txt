Demolition Man (1993)

Frozen in 1996, Phoenix, a convicted killer is "thawed" out for parole well 
into the 21st century. Revived into a crime free society, Phoenix resumes 
his murderous rampage, and no one can stop him. Spartan, the cop who

a crime he didn't commit. In desperation they turn to Spartan to help 
recapture Phoenix. 
Los Angeles in the year 1996. The streets are ruled by acts of violence and 
terror, nothing and nobody is safe. Simon Phoenix is one of the worst 
criminals that Los Angeles has ever seen, and only one man can stop him - 
L.A.P.D. officer John "Demotion Man" Spartan. When John apprehended 
Phoenix, he was surprisingly found as an accessory to the recent crime and 
was also sent to the "Cryo Prison". During John Spartan's sentence, Los 
Angeles' theme and society had dramatically changed from one of violence to 
one of peace. Phoenix, revived for a parole hearing managed to escape and 
uses Los Angles to his advantage. The Police are unable to stop him with 
their non-violent solutions and have no choice but to let out John Spartan 
to stop him. Now, Spartan not only has to stop Phoenix, but to adapt 
himself to the future society he has no knowledge about.
