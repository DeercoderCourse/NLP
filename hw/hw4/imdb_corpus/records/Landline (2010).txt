customer at the store. Aaron is smitten with Kristen, but he is still 
recovering from a long-term break up . He finally works up the nerve to ask 
her out on a first date. It goes well, but then the date ends strangely, 
abruptly, awkwardly. Kristen, feeling jilted, blurts out the first thing 
that comes to her mind, "I'll call you." "I'll Call You." Aaron becomes 
fixated on Kristen's parting words, At first he just contemplates the 
possibility of her calling for a second date, but his thoughts quickly 
dissolve into obsession. Adding to his frustration are constant 
distractions from a nosy neighbor, a bartender with questionable motives, 
and his best friend Steve. Aaron becomes consumed by the idea that she will 
call. Relying on his antiquated land-line he cuts himself off from the 
outside world. He is left isolated, holed up in his apartment as he waits 
for a phone call that may never come. Aaron's desire to be loved and his 
contempt for loneliness eventually take a toll on his physical and mental 
well-being. On the brink of madness, the only thing that can save him would 
be a call from Kristen. Will she call him before it's too late? Or will 
someone else save him from going off the deep end?
