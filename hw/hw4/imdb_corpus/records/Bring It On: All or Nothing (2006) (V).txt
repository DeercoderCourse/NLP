Bring It On: All or Nothing (2006) (V)

Britney Allen is living the dream -- the cheerleader's dream. At the elite 
seaside campus of Pacific Vista High School, Britney is captain of the 
cheerleading squad and the envy of everyone at school -- including one 
overly-ambitious teammate. When Britney hears about a forthcoming audition 
for a top cheer squad to appear in recording star Rihanna's upcoming 
television special, she is determined that her Pirates cheer squad will 
capture the coveted spot. But Britney's life turns from cheer-topia to 
cheer-tastrophe when her father's job takes her family to Crenshaw Heights, 
a multi-ethnic working-class neighborhood east of Los Angeles. At her new 
school, Britney is viewed with suspicion by most of the students, 
especially by Camille, the overly confident and acerbic leader of the 
Crenshaw Heights Warriors cheerleading squad. No one is more surprised than 
Camille, however, when Britney proves herself and secures a spot on the 
Warriors' cheer squad. Britney and her new teammates work feverishly to 
prepare for the audition for Rihanna, incorporating some edgy new moves 
into their performance. Now the pressure is on, as the Warriors find 
themselves locked in a high-stakes cheer-off with Pacific Vista, Britney's 
old school! During the no-holds-barred fight to the finish, friendships, 
loyalties and talents are tested -- but only one team can come out on top.
