"Haven" (2010)

A shrewd FBI agent with a lost past who arrives in the small town of Haven, 
Maine, to solve the murder of a local ex-con only to discover that the 
curious enclave is a longtime refuge for people with supernatural powers 
that holds a lot of secrets, including to her own past. 
She has no past. She has no family. She was raised in an orphanage. So, she 
lives for what she does best: be an FBI agent. That's why Audrey Parker is 
sent to a distant Maine village called Haven, to investigate the crime of a 
prison fugitive. What she does not know, is that her past is connected to 
that village, that old threats from the past are coming back, and she is 
going to be a central piece on everyone's life... or death. 
FBI agent Audrey Parker arrives in Haven, Maine, to help the local police 
and joins forces with the Chief's son, Nathan Warnous. Whilst helping with 
everything in the small town Audrey finds out truths she never would've 
expected and together she and Nathan begin to unravel the 'troubles' that 
surround the local area and begin to become more and more engrossed with 
what is causing the strange occurences that are terrifying and even killing 
the locals.
