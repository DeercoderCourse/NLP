One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)

Pongo and Perdita have a litter of 15 puppies. Cruella De Vil takes a fancy 
to the pups, and wants to get hold of them, as well as more pups, to make 
herself a lovely dalmatian skin coat... Cruella hires some thugs to kidnap 
the pups and hold them at her mansion. Will Pongo and Perdita find them in 
time ? 
Pongo is a male Dalmatian living in London with his master, Roger, a 
bachelor songwriter who has yet to sell his first tune. Bored with their 
single existence, Pongo arranges for Roger to meet Anita, a pretty young 
woman who just happens to have a female Dalmatian named Perdita. It is not 
long before love blossoms all around and a double wedding takes place. A 
few months later, Perdita gives birth to 15 puppies, much to the delight of 
Cruella De Vil, a wealthy, wicked former schoolmate of Anita's whose 
burning passion is to own a coat made of Dalmatian pelts. When she is 
unable to purchase the puppies, she has them "dognapped" and brought to her 
crumbling estate in the country, where 84 other Dalmatians are also being 
held captive. All attempts by the police to find the missing pups fail, and 
the desperate Pongo and Perdita appeal to the dogs of London, via the 
"twilight bark." Led by The Colonel, an indomitable shaggy dog and a cat 
named Sergeant Tibbs, all dogdom comes to the rescue and, aided by geese, 
cows, and horses, tracks down the missing puppies.
