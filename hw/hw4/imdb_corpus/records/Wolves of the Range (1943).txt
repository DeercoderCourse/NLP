Wolves of the Range (1943)

Dorn is after the rancher's land and is trying to stop Banker Brady from 
helping them. When his man Hammond kills Brady, there is a run on the bank. 
When Rocky volunteers to ride to the next town for money, he is ambushed by 
Dorn's men, loses his memory, and is jailed for supposedly stealing the 
money. 
In the 15th of seventeen films in this series (preceded by "Death Rides the 
Plains" and followed by "Law of the Saddle"), Harry Dorn, head of the 
Cattleman's Association, and his gang of henchmen, stage a series of raid 
in order to freeze-out the ranchers and take possession of their lands. Dam 
Brady, town banker, lends money to tide the ranchers over and Dorn has him 
killed and the bank money stolen. "Rocky" Cameron, The Lone Rider when he 
wears a mask, undertakes the mission of bringing $50,000 through the old 
Pony Express Trail, to save the bank, for Brady's daughter Ann and the 
ranchers. He is ambushed by Dorn's henchies but manages to hide the money 
before falling wounded. He is rescued by his sidekick, "Fuzzy" Jones and 
the ranchers, but they discover he has lost his memory and forgotten where 
he hid the money. And there is less than 48 hours before the bank has to 
open and face the irate depositors demanding their money...which the bank 
doesn't have.
