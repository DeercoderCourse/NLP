Let It Bleed (2010)

Aidan and Madison are young and in love. They have a dream existence, 
surrounded by close friends and all the excitement New York City can offer 
a vibrant young couple. But when a mysterious black box appears at Aidan's 
doorstep, his dream of proposing to Madison and the very world he has built 
for them begin to unravel... 
Aidan is a young man living his dream in New York City, until he awakens 
one morning to find a mysterious black box containing a DVD with the words 
"Play Me" on it, outside his front door. To Aidan's horror, the DVD 
contains a sadistic video of a young girl tied up at the hands of a 
knife-wielding maniac in a black mask. Aidan's world turns upside down when 
he finally recognizes the young hostage on the tape: his girlfriend 
Madison. As Aidan struggles to cope with the horrifying images he sees, we 
relive his charmed life with Madison as a young couple in love and 
surrounded by close friends. But the bonds they have forged are more than 
what they seem, and Aidan must race to make sense of who could tear his 
dream apart and why, before it's too late for both Madison and for himself.
