An Assisted Proposal (1913)

Ellen sends out invitations for a mask dance. Joe, after securing some 
masks, lets Kate know what his costume is to be. It happens that Joe is 
called away to attend to some business and he writes a note to Kate that he 
will try to return in time for the dance. Jim promises to deliver this 
note, but changes his mind, knowing that Joe has made several unsuccessful 
attempts to propose to Kate. Jim decides to go to the dance in Joe's place, 
wearing Joe's costume and mask. At the dance Jim proposes to Kate and she 
accepts, thinking the man behind the mask is Joe. Joe, returning from his 
business trip on the night of the party, finds his costume gone. He hurries 
to the dance and makes Jim give it to him. Joe puts on his mask and costume 
and when Kate appears he is embarrassed by her affectionate actions. Jim, 
in the meantime, has brought a minister to the house. Just before they 
arrive Kate has asked Joe: "When shall we be married?" Joe, thunderstruck, 
tries to get away from the crowd who have overheard Kate's remark. The 
cowboys held Joe and the minister performs the ceremony. Jim and the boys 
then explain to Joe how it all happened.
