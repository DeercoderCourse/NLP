Safari (1999)

Bombay-based Anjali Aggarwal lives a wealthy lifestyle with her mom, Asha, 
and dad, Ajit, who is the owner of Aggarwal Industries. When Asha 
challenges Ajit that she can run the business better, he accepts the 
challenge, and Asha is determined to do better than him. Her plan is to 
expand into a small island called Manjira located in the Indian Ocean off 
of Lakhwadeep Islands, and build a factory there. She finds out that the 
island natives are opposed to any construction of any kind. She decides to 
send her to-be son-in-law, Shekhar Panchotia, but when he meets with an 
accident, Anjali goes in his place, flies Uncle D'Silva's plane, films a 
murder by Gwana and his men, crash-lands, is rescued by Kishan Khanna alias 
Captain and returned safely to her worried parents, who are grateful to 
Kishan and they invite him to visit them in Bombay. Kishan does accept 
their invitation and goes to visit them, rescues Anjali when she is 
abducted by Gwana and his men, and both fall in love with each other. On 
the day they are to be engaged to each other, Asha and Shekhar find out 
that Kishan had only seduced Anjali so that he could get Aggarwal family to 
change their mind about building a factory in Manjira. Watch what happens 
when Anjali finds out, and the impact this has on her and on the Aggarwals.
