Harvest Nation (2012)

For years man has thought he was the Supreme Being on Earth after all look 
at what he has accomplished. For years man has tried to go further then 
ever before from the first mission to the moon to the probes sent to Mars. 
A bright yellow sun fills the screen as we pull away and take a journey 
through space white specks are visible of far away stars as our tour of the 
solar system continues passing planets. As we approach Earth traffic 
surrounds the planet satellites and space ships and quite a large space 
station the size of a small housing estate can also been seen orbiting the 
Earth. As we pass on our continuing journey the atmosphere of our once 
clean planet as changed radically a dull mist covers most of the Earth and 
only a few specks of blue sea and land is visible. As we close in on Mars 
our nearest planet again some space traffic can be seen and the once red 
planet seem to be under some sort of transformation process as lakes and 
green lands can be seen clearly from orbit. On board a research station 
orbiting Mars a secret has been discovered, a secret that has been long 
hidden, a secret that can throw the whole evolution of man into chaos. The 
Bacteria found on Mars in the early days of exploration was not that of a 
previous thriving planet ravaged by the elements but like Earth it was the 
beginning.
