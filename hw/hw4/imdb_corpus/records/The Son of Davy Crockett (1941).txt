The Son of Davy Crockett (1941)

The last solo-starring feature film Bill Elliott made for Columbia, as his 
next eight westerns for Columbia featured Tex Ritter as his co-star. Young 
Dave Crockett and his sidekick Cannonball find themselves on the trail of 
water-hole poisoners in the territory known as The Yucca Strip which, 
through a surveying error, is neither part of the United States nor Indian 
Territory. King Canfield, self-appointed ruler of the strip, is determined 
to see that the residents can't vote themselves into the Union through an 
honest election. Crockett and Cannonball side with the ranchers and 
townspeople against Canfield and his legion of henchmen to establish the 
strip as part of Texas.Accuracy footnote: Gail Pictures, Inc. had no 
connection at all to the production of this film (as shown on site), as 
Gail Pictures was a TV distributor only. Columbia produced and distributed 
it to theaters, and Gail had it for television, while Astor pictures had it 
for re-issue showings after WW II. 
Due to a surveying error the Yucca Strip is neither in the United States or 
Mexico and is ruthlessly controlled by King Canfield. So President Grant 
sends Dave Crockett as his unofficial agent. Dave gets Canfield to allow a 
vote but Canfield then puts his gang to work coercing the men to make sure 
the vote fails.
