"Sealab 2021" (2000)

The year is 2021. Deep below the ocean's surface, looms a vast, 
magnificently high-tech compound: Sealab. A multi-national scientific 
station with an annual budget in the trillions, dedicated to the research 
and exploration of man's final frontier... Sealab's crew is charged with 
exploring the possibility of underwater colonization. As the Earth's 
surface, by this time, has gotten just generally crowded, hot, and icky. 
However, as most government-funded agencies usually are, Sealab is manned 
by a motley collection of malcontents and screw-ups who were unfit for work 
in the private sector. They really don't get any research done, but instead 
spend their time bickering among themselves. Or just plain goofing off. The 
crew have manipulated their luckless leader, Captain Murphy, into 
submission, and are content to ride the government clock, raking in fat, 
hazardous-duty paychecks. 
This is a remake using old animation from Hanna-Barbera's Sealab 2020, 
which was an educational cartoon about the environment. The premise for 
Sealab 2021 is that all of the characters have gone insane. Few if any 
characters on the show would be deemed able to run a trillion-dollar 
research station, especially Captain Murphy, who is left in charge. The 
plot of each show is usually absurd, and always hilarious.
