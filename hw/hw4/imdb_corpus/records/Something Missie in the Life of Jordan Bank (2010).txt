Something Missie in the Life of Jordan Bank (2010)

Something Missie in the Life of Jordan Bank is an unsettling tale of loss 
and misdirected love. As a child, Jordan withdraws deep into the world of 
his own imagination due to constant ridicule from his peers. An intense 
interest in science and the care of his menagerie of animals takes up most 
of Jordan's time. His closest human companion is his mother, whose tendency 
to periodically drift into sleep is a source of concern for Jordan. He 
intuitively suspects that his mother is actually suffering from a much more 
serious condition that may threaten her life. On Christmas, Jordan is 
overjoyed when he finally receives the only gift he has always wanted: a 
real pet monkey. However not long after he gets her, Missie the monkey is 
killed in a tragic accident. Devastated, Jordan blames himself for her 
death. He cannot face the possibility of losing his mother as well. As an 
adult, Jordan devotedly cares for his declining mother while he strives to 
become a leading genetic engineer. Haunted by loneliness and memories of 
Missie, Jordan vows to reclaim his childhood love. His nightmares serve as 
road maps in his quest, leading him to use his scientific knowledge to 
create the love of his life. Consumed by delusions, Jordan exhumes his lost 
friend from the grave and converts his entire home, including his mother, 
into a massive scientific operation. As his mother's health wanes, Jordan 
stops at nothing to make his dreams come to life.
