"O Clone" (2001)

The meeting of a man with his image 20 years younger. This is the plot of O 
Clone. In the beggining of the story Lucas is a happy adolescent, romantic, 
full of projects, and he's in love with a young arabic girl: Jade. But life 
didn't run well for him: he separates with Jade and, during the twenty 
years that have passed during the novel, he's not the same thing 
physically, his projects are lost by the way, he has no more the 
tenderness, the romantic atmosphere, and the poetry of before. He's now dry 
by inside. Jade, in the other side, lived all this time imagining that her 
life would be much happier if she had married him. Twenty years later they 
meet again. Jade gets upset, trying to find, in the forty years old Lucas, 
what is left from the person she once fell in love with. That's when the 
clone appears, made by Lucas' godfather without his knowledge, the 
geneticist Albieri. The clone is not Lucas, but it is the image that Jade 
loved during her whole life. We have then, an uncommon love triangle: Lucas 
becoming the rival of himself. The appearing of the clone changes 
completely the lifes of the other characters of the plot.
