The Outlaw (1943)

Newly appointed sheriff Pat Garrett is pleased when his old friend Doc 
Holliday arrives in Lincoln, New Mexico on the stage. Doc is trailing his 
stolen horse, and it is discovered in the possession of Billy the Kid. In a 
surprising turnaround, Billy and Doc become friends. This causes the 
friendship between Doc and Pat to cool. The odd relationship between Doc 
and Billy grows stranger when Doc hides Billy at his girl, Rio's, place 
after Billy is shot. She falls for Billy, although he treats her very 
badly. Interaction between these four is played out against an Indian 
attack before a final showdown reduces the group's number. 
In the Nineteenth Century, in the town of Lincoln, New Mexico, the sheriff 
Pat Garrett welcomes his old friend, Doc Holliday, who has had his horse 
Red stolen by a stranger while coming to the town. They meet the thieve and 
realize that the guy is the gunman Billy the Kid. Doc becomes friend of 
Billy, but Pat invites them to leave Lincoln in the afternoon. There is an 
incident, Pat wounds Billy the Kid, and Doc asks his girlfriend Rio 
McDonald to take care of Billy while he would misguide Pat Garret t and his 
officers. There is a romance between Billy the Kid and Rio, and when the 
hit-man is healed, he disputes with Doc the possession of Red and Rio, with 
Pat Garrett chasing them. On 13 July 1881, this hunting ends in a tragic 
way.
