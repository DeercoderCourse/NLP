Homicidal (1961)

The story centers around a murderous scheme to collect a rich inheritance. 
The object of murder is Miriam Webster, who is to share in the inheritance 
with her half brother Warren, who lives with his childhood guardian Helga 
in the mansion where Warren and Mariam grew up. Confined to a wheelchair 
after recently suffering a stroke, Helga is cared for by her nurse Emily, a 
strange young woman who has formed a close bond with Warren. 
Miriam Webster is happy when her half brother Warren and their childhood 
nanny Helga, now partly paralyzed and unable to speak, return to the United 
States after a lengthy stay in Europe. Warren will soon turn 21 and will 
inherit their father's $10 million estate and although she will get nothing 
- their father's will specified that only a male heir could inherit - she's 
happy in her circumstances. One person she doesn't like however is Emily 
who came with Warren and Helga from Europe and now lives with them as a 
housekeeper/companion. Miriam has good reason not to like her as she seems 
to be a homicidal maniac. What Miriam doesn't realize is that there is 
method behind Emily's madness and a deep family secret that she is not 
privy to.
