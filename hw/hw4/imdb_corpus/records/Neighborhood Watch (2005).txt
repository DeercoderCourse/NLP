Neighborhood Watch (2005)

Nothing bad could ever happen on quiet, tree lined Wormwood Drive. At least 
that's what Bob and Wendi Petersen thought, before they met their new 
neighbor... Having moved across country so that Bob can begin a dream job 
with Zeecor, a large industrial corporation, the newly married couple 
looked forward to starting a new life together, far away from the crime and 
violence of the big city. Zeecor even provided them with a spacious company 
home on a peaceful suburban street. What more could a young couple ask for? 
But behind every perfect neighborhood, there hides a dark secret. On 
Wormwood Drive that secret is named Adrien Trumbull. Seemingly friendly, 
yet disturbingly intense, the hulking Trumbull welcomes his young new 
neighbors with a greeting of a box chocolates and kind words. Touched by 
his neighborly gestures, Bob and Wendi gratefully accept Trumbull's 
thoughtful gifts and friendship. However, Trumbull is not at all what he 
seems to be. Behind his welcoming grin lurks a dark obsession with poison 
and self-mutilation and within the walls of his rancid home, hides pure 
madness. For Bob and Wendi Petersen, the neighborhood of their dreams is 
about to become a living nightmare. As darkness falls, they will soon learn 
the true meaning of fear. For on Wormwood Drive, the night has eyes and the 
neighbors are watching. Based on two true stories.
