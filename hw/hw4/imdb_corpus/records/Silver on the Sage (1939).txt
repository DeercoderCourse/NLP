Silver on the Sage (1939)

Hoppy goes undercover as a gambler from the East when Bar 20 cattle are 
stolen by unknown rustlers. Brennan/Talbot are twin brothers (one a casino 
owner, the other a rancher) and Hoppy believes they provide alibis for each 
other while one is out committing crimes. Hoppy gets a job in the casino to 
learn more but is exposed when a gambling gunslinger notices him. 
Getting involved in a frontier clash between cattlemen and rustlers when a 
herd belonging to the Bar 20 is rustled, "Hopalong" Cassidy plays a 
dangerous game. Posing as an outlaw himself, he wins the confidence of the 
gang through his prowess gambling at the card-tables and his recklessness 
on the range. To maintain his cover, he even allows "Lucky" Jenkins to be 
taken to jail, charged with a murder the rustlers had committed. Cassidy's 
"game" brings results when he realizes that the gambling-hall owner and the 
foreman of a ranch are identical twins. 
Lucky and Windy have their herd rustled. When Lucky, the ranch owner, and 
his foreman Talbot investigate, the owner is murdered. Lucky is jailed as 
Talbot was playing cards with Hoppy at the time of the murder. The next 
time Hoppy plays cards with Talbot he realizes it is a different man. 
Saloon owner Brennan resembles Talbot so Hoppy gets him to deal a hand. Now 
knowing Brennan was posing as Talbot when the murder occurred, he has to 
prove it.
