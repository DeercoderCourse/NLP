Dog Factory (1904)

Two men are operating a 'dog factory', using a device that they call a Dog 
Transformator. A man brings three dogs into their shop, which they purchase 
from him. They place the dogs one by one into the machine, which turns each 
dog into a string of sausages. As their customers come in, they are then 
able to select the kind of dog that they want, and the machine changes the 
corresponding string of sausages back into a dog. 
On the walls of the factory a lot of different varieties of frankfurters 
are hung. Each is marked with the breed of dog it is made from. A combined 
dog and bologna making machine is seen in the foreground, and two Germans 
are working industriously over it. A tramp enters with about a dozen dogs 
of various types, and sells them to the Germans. They are soon transformed 
into sausage and the tramp departs with cash. A dude now enters who wants 
to buy a spaniel. The dog is quickly made and sold. A number of customers 
follow and are supplied with dogs that suit their fancies. Finally a tough 
enters who wants a bull dog. A Boston Bull is produced, but does not suit 
him. He wants a fighting bull. The dog is made, and as he jumps from the 
machine he grabs the tough by the pants, and dog and man mix up in a 
rolling match all over the floor. The tough finally releases himself and 
disappears, leaving the fighting bull dog to be again turned into bologna.
