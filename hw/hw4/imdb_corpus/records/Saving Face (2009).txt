Saving Face (2009)

This experimental film follows three dogs on their hospital beds, which are 
the subjects of medical experimentation and brought back to life by means 
of mechanical manipulation. Each of the dogs' journeys from death to life 
is partnered with an appropriate song in the soundtrack. The combination of 
the three songs and three dogs provides the structure for the music video 
trilogy. Reincarnation, literally "to be made flesh again", is a belief 
that some essential part of a living being survives death to be reborn in a 
new body. This essential part is often referred to as the spirit or soul, 
the "higher" or "true" self, or the "divine spark." According to such 
beliefs, a new personality is developed during each life in the physical 
world, but some part of the self remains constant throughout the successive 
lives. Belief in reincarnation has ancient roots, but during recent decades 
a significant minority of people in the West have developed a belief in 
reincarnation. But, in an age filled with tools and machines, what causes a 
heart to reestablish its appropriate rhythm? During this film, the 
soundtrack makes the viewer question whether it is, in fact, the machines 
used by the doctors on the screen or if it is the beckoning, soulful vocals 
in the soundtrack that calls and brings the souls of the three dogs back to 
life.
