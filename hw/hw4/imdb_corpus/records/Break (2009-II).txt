Break (2009/II)

The sudden break in the relationship with her boyfriend leaves Sarah Carter 
devastated. So her 3 friends Rose, Clare and Anna decide to cheer her up by 
taking her on a trip in the Canadian woods. While on their way to the 
secluded lake where the four want to spend the weekend, they meet charming 
hiker Eric, who nearly immediately falls for Clare's sparkling personality. 
Still, it's a girl-only weekend and the young women can't wait to go skinny 
dipping. The beautiful lake, warm summer weather and some cool beer soon 
have the group forgetting about their big city problems - until Anna trips 
over a pile of intestines. And right beside it the terrified girls find a 
pair of hacked-off human feet dangling from a tree. The moment they realize 
that humans have become the preferred prey in this area, the two rednecks 
responsible for those gruesome killings start to hunt them down with bow 
and arrows. When Clare suffers a nearly fatal shot in the head, and Anna 
and Rose get captured by the sadistic duo, it is Sarah, who must find a way 
to get help. But the inbreed Phillip is hard on her heels. And he knows the 
territory very well.
