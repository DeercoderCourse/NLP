City Rats (2009)

Eight haunted people meet and fall apart - looking for redemption in each 
other. Jim is throwing watermelons off his office roof. He's testing the 
effect for a possible suicide. But then there is Sue on an adjacent roof 
about to jump herself. They meet, delay their departure and set off 
searching for other ways out than down. Sue's ex-boyfriend, Dean, is 
struggling with his creativity. His paintings are getting panned and his 
poetry ripped apart. He needs a muse - and who better than Gina, the 
experimental prostitute with dodgy legs who lives next door. However, Dean 
soon finds out that Gina never does anything for free. After a short fling 
with Dean, Olly is lost in a world of sexual confusion when forced to look 
after his deaf-mute brother Chris for the day. Olly discovers that not only 
does Chris has gay feelings too, but is more comfortable with them than he 
is. They embark on a searing quest through Soho's gay community to help 
Chris loose his virginity. But no-one has more to hide than oldest brother 
Pete. He's being stalked by Carol, a timid old lady looking for her son - a 
guy Pete knew from his violent drug days. Fearfully Pete opens his frozen 
heart to Carol and they begin a treacherous journey to the woods to find 
her lost son. By the end, each lost soul finds a solution in darkness or in 
light. Connections are made or missed and longed-for families brought 
together for a moment of hope.
