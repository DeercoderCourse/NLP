Evolution (2001)

When a meteorite falls to Earth two college professors, Dr. Ira Kane and 
Prof. Harry Phineas Block, are assigned the job of checking the site out. 
At the site, they discover organisms not of this planet. Soon the site is 
taken over by the government, forcing Ira and Harry to the side. As the new 
life-forms begin to evolve and start to get more and more dangerous, it's 
up to the two professors to save the planet. 
Glen Canyon, Arizona, the present day. Wayne, practising at night in the 
desert for his upcoming fireman's exam, witnesses the impact of a 
meteorite. The next day, biology teacher Dr. Ira Kane and geology teacher 
Harry Block from Glen Canyon Community College manage to get to the 
meteorite, which is stuck in the ground at the bottom of a cave. By taking 
a sample, they discover a slimy blue fluid coming out of the meteorite. A 
little later, Ira Kane finds out that myriads of single-celled life-forms 
dwell in the fluid, evolve at an incredible rate, even while he's watching. 
What first seems like a sure ticket to Sweden for the Nobel Prize soon 
develops into a nightmare: By evolving and adapting at that unbelievably 
fast rate, the Aliens start spreading out, and the Military comes in. Now 
it all comes down to what Darwin so rightfully stated: Survival of the 
fittest. And no good idea in sight...
