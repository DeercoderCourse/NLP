The past is never far behind. True for anyone as it is for Nick Knight, an 
eight hundred year old vampire struggling to recant his old violent ways 
and seek the humanity he lost the only way he can as a homicide detective 
on the Toronto police force. With him on his quest is beautiful forensics 
Doctor Natalie Lambert, one of the few humans to know of his true nature 
and committed to helping him regain his mortality. His partner Don Schanke, 
who while Nick's friend, is unaware of his supernatural powers, which has 
been causing a steady anger as to why Nick is always the first man on the 
scene. His master, Lucien LaCroix, whose persona as a radio call-in host 
called the Nightcrawler seems to home in on Nick's thoughts when faced with 
the dilemma of a case. His friend, confidant and one time paramour Janette, 
who sees Nick's quest to regain his humanity as nothing more than a long 
chain of folly, but still cares enough for the wayward vampire to lend a 
helpful ear, a much-needed voice and herself when Nick's true nature 
reasserts itself. Life can be hell; penance can be worse.
