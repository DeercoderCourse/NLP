Near Dark (1987)

A mid-western farm boy reluctantly becomes a member of the undead when a 
girl he meets turns out to be part of a band of southern vampires who roam 
the highways in stolen cars. Part of his initiation includes a bloody 
assault on a hick bar. 
In Phoenix, the young cowboy Caleb Colton meets the beautiful Mae late 
night in town and she asks for a ride to her trailer. It is near dawn and 
Caleb brings Mae that is in a hurry; he asks for a kiss and she bites him 
on the neck. Caleb's truck does not start and he walks home. However, when 
the sunlight hits him close to his farm, he starts to burn. His father Loy 
Colton and his sister Sarah witness a van that appears out of the blue and 
kidnaps Caleb. He is introduced to Mae's family: the leader Jesse Hooker, 
his mate Diamondback, the cruel Severen and the boy Homer. In common, all 
of them are predator creatures of night that need blood to survive. 
However, Caleb refuses to kill and Mae gives her own blood to him to keep 
him alive. Meanwhile Loy and Sarah are looking for Caleb; when they meet 
each other in a motel, Caleb has to choose between his beloved family or 
his love for Mae.
