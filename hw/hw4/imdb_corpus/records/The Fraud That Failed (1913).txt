The Fraud That Failed (1913)

Mrs. Wren and her pretty daughter, Mabel, lived alone on a desolate ranch. 
Few neighbors they had and the nearest were Ricketts and his wife. Ricketts 
had long coveted the fine ranch owned by Mrs. Wren and went one day to see 
how he might defraud her out of it. In a spirit of fake friendship, he 
commented on the condition of the ranch. He finally offered to buy and the 
lonesome woman readily agreed. Home went Ricketts and soon returned with a 
fake deed, not calculating on the handsome young man who had ridden in and 
chatted with the women. With that fine instinct which unconsciously 
suspects foul play, the ranger, after being informed the reason for the 
deed, asked permission to examine it. This he did with curious eyes and 
soon discovered the joker in the contract. Instantly animosity sprang up 
between them. Off they went on horseback, down the mountainside, firing 
shot after shot. The ranger's horse, being the faster of the two, soon 
overhauled that of Ricketts. They engaged in a deadly embrace, swinging 
treacherously to and fro over the backs of their galloping horses. With a 
death grip on Rickett's throat, the ranger bore him over the side and they 
both fell into the dust of the road. Returning to the desolate ranch, the 
eyes of the ranger swept the graceful form of Mabel. He visited a few days 
and decided, with Mabel's permission, that he would stay forever and a day.
