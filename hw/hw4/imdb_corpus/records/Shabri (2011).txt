Shabri (2011)

Shabri lives an impoverished lifestyle along with her mother; alcoholic 
father; and younger brother, Bandya. She is the sole earner in her family 
and embittered at the manner in which life has treated her. She not only 
chastises Bandya for spending too much time on the street with a goon, 
Murad, instead of focusing in his studies but also her father. Things take 
a turn for the worst when Bandya is arrested by Inspector Khare and 
tortured in the police station. When Shabri goes to see him, Khare attempts 
to molest her, but she manages to escape. The next day Bandya is found dead 
allegedly on the grounds that he tried to escape from police custody. 
Refusing to believe this 'version', Shabri takes a knife and goes to 
confront Khare. It is this confrontation that will result in Khare's death 
with his own service revolver, resulting in a manhunt from Vikhroli to 
Bhendi Bazar, and she will be compelled to seek Murad's help to go in 
hiding. But things are only to worsen when a heavily pressured Murad 
decides to enlist the assistance of Kisnya Bhau, the brother of gangster, 
Rajdharbhau, resulting in more danger for not only Shabri but also her 
parents.
