Young Lori Anderson lost her father in a plane crash. While her mother 
appears to be picking up the pieces of her life, Lori isn't. She is 
resentful of every decision that her mother makes from selling the family 
horse farm to a relationship with the local sherrif. Lori doesn't know what 
to do and turns to her father's journals filled with psychology and 
metaphysics for answers. One day, a client coming to see about the boarding 
of his horse, crashes in a plane with his best friend. The friend manages 
to escape tragedy, but the client, Terry Stockton, dies in the accident. 
However, Lori can see and actually touch the supposedly dead Terry after 
she finds him in the woods. After some struggle, Lori comes to believe that 
she is meant to help Terry. With the aid of her father's journals and 
Terry's best friend, they try to find out why Terry's spirit hasn't crossed 
over. A complication then develops in the situation when Lori and Terry 
begin to fall for each other. Lori has a riding accident and tries to join 
Terry in the afterlife. It is then that the reason why Terry had trouble 
passing on, and the secrets of her father's journals are revealed...
