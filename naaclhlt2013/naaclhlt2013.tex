\title{Instructions for NAACL HLT 2013 Proceedings\Thanks{This
    document has been adapted from the instructions for earlier ACL
    and NAACL proceedings, including those for 
    NAACL-HLT-12 by Nizar Habash and William Schuler,
    NAACL-HLT-10 by Claudia Leacock and Richard Wicentowski,
    NAACL-HLT-09 by Joakim Nivre and Noah Smith, 
    for ACL-05 by Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal Oflazer,
    for ACL-02 by Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and earlier ACL and
    EACL formats.  Those versions were written by several people,
    including John Chen, Henry S. Thompson and Donald Walker.
    Additional elements were taken from the formatting instructions of
    the {\em International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence}.  
    This second version clarifies the procedure for 
    submitting for double-blind reviewing.}}

\begin{abstract}
  This document contains the instructions for preparing a camera-ready
  manuscript for the proceedings of NAACL HLT 2013.  The document itself conforms
  to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of what
  your manuscript should look like.  Papers are required to conform to
  all the directions reported in this document.  Also included are instructions for
  submission to the conference, which are similar to the camera-ready instructions
  but remove author-identifying information.
