\section{Introduction}


This document is used to record the weekly update for me in my NLP project. This is the first update for our project in 2nd week.

\section{Identify your project topic}

I plan to do something related with my focus on \textbf{CNN}(Convolutional Neural Network), so I still try to find some work that can combine CNN with the text processing tasks.

\section{Summary}

In this week, I just started the NLP class and learned new concepts and open source project, for example NLTK. For the project, I find a partner Ning Zhang who will work with me on the project, and I plan to explore more about the CNN's application in text processing, especially in the document classification area.

I will try to find some papers to read and know how it goes in the current trend.
